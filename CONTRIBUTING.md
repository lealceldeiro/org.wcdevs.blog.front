### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are 
creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).
Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/lealceldeiro/org.wcdevs.blog.front/issues/new?assignees=lealceldeiro&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D+),
the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new
> issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Perform a [search](https://github.com/lealceldeiro/org.wcdevs.blog.front/labels/bug)** to see if the problem has
already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of
opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue by providing the
following information by filling in
[the template](https://github.com/lealceldeiro/org.wcdevs.blog.front/issues/new?assignees=lealceldeiro&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D+).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable
snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use
[Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that
behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the
problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast)
on Linux.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.
